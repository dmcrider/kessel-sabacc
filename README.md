# Kessel Sabacc

#### Note: All names are copyright and trademark by their respective owners. I do not claim ownership for the concept of this game - I just wanted to use it as a way to learn Tauri and React

Play a simplified game of Kessel Sabacc! No shift tokens or cheats in this version (but maybe in the future!).

I'm mainly using this as an opportunity to learn React, so code-reviews and suggestions are welcome!
